== Introduction

Blockchain, the keyword itself implied series of blocks and assumed that blocks would have some information added to them. Distributed Ledger Technology
The blockchain is not a strange keyword anymore in this era; everyone talks about it in their daily life.
However, not everyone can understand blockchain clearly and explain the whole concept, so in a line, it is - "Series of blocks with linked cryptographic hashes in a chronological way."

Most of the people think - Blockchain and Bitcoin[1] are same! Yes, they feel like that. Well, it's not the case they different, blockchain is an underlying concept of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin made debut in 2009 and got attention from every tech-savvy over the globe as it was a system using blockchain and p2p network, and proposing a solution to resolve double spending problem[2] and enable borderless electronic payment transactions. It was a classic peer to peer transaction system owned and supported by the developer community and public. After 2009, when Bitcoin was struggling yet rising in the market, other incubator projects were in progress which could overcome potential problems faced in bitcoin system and provide faster transactions for electronic payment transactions. Also, tech pioneers started implementing blockchain in other fields such as real estate, healthcare, and education, etc. I will explain all these as we go through this document. 

=== Blockchain origins

The origins of blockchain technology can be traced to 1991 when Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta represented the initial effort on a cryptographically secured series of blocks. In 1992, they took advantage of Merkle trees and combined it into the design resulting in a new enhanced system which allowed to collect several documents in a block, and several blocks are linked together building a chain.

Well, that was long ago. At present, it wouldn't be wrong to say that the blockchain technology gained significance in 2008 when a mysterious person named "Satoshi Nakamoto" came up with the Bitcoin white paper. Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a practical approach to solving the problem of double spending using same blockchain technology. Another fact which still amazes people is that nobody knows who Satoshi Nakamoto was and its still a mystery.

=== The concept

The key term is distributed ledger technology (DLT), which includes blockchain and smart contracts. Distributed ledger is a type of data structure within a block. 
The blockchain is a chronological chain of blocks, in which each block had a set of multiple transactions and added to the chain including timestamp and cryptographic hash, ultimately providing immutable records for all the transactions. 

The block contains bundled transaction records, a reference to the previous block, proof of work and timestamp. The blockchain can reside across multiple computing devices, generally spread across locations or regions to form a distributed peer to peer network and it uses consensus algorithm to provide immutability.

==== Blockchain - DataStorage

We will have a look at blockchain and block data depiction as below -

The main chain (black) consists of the longest series of blocks from the genesis block (green) to the current block. Orphan blocks (purple) exist outside of the main chain."[Wikipedia]

The block data gives us an overview of all the things inside a block. As you can see that block 11 contains transactions that are hashed and bundled called tx_root,  previous hash to block 10, a timestamp and nonce (proof of work). Tx_root is a Merkle tree, which contains hashes of all the transactions. 

==== Blockchain - Data Distribution

Distributed ledger technologies like blockchain work on the peer to peer (p2p) network models, meaning every peer has same data and updates will be applied to all of them. 

This is more efficient than client-server architecture and no central control over changing states of the ledger.

==== Blockchain - Consensus 

The consensus is the process of achieving agreement among the network participants as to the correct state of data on the system.

In the blockchain, as multiple participants are adding blocks, it may be you see different versions of the same block. For resolving these conflicts, the consensus algorithm varies with varying implementations of the blockchain. In Bitcoin, its determined by using the most extended chain rule, i.e., Proof of Work. There are others, like the Proof of Burn, Proof of Stake,  Proof of Capacity, Proof of Elapsed Time, and many others, it all depends on the unique requirements of that blockchain system.

* Proof of work requires a lot of energy, and the possible threat to the blockchain system, because it can alter blockchain if some peers in the network own 51% of the ledger.

==== Blockchain - Read/Write
As its a distributed ledger, everyone, who owns a decent computer with enough power, is allowed to use the source code and read-write ledger state.

However, these can be controlled based on what kind of blockchain you are using, i.e., permissioned or permissionless. Bitcoin is a permissionless blockchain technology; anyone can download and start using it.

===== Permissionless blockchain
The permissionless blockchain is publicly owned blockchain network, where anyone and can join the network without any signup process or verification and start contributing to reading/writing process of the ledger.  Bitcoin is widely known example for such blockchain, and there are more.

===== Permissioned blockchain
The permissioned blockchain is private blockchain where membership is required in some form.  To use permissioned blockchain network, we need to meet some predefined criteria. 
Permissioned blockchains are generally company owned. 

===== Public vs Private 
Now we know that two kinds of blockchains are there already. These can be further categorized based on the access provided to users in the network. A Permissionless blockchain may be public or private. Similarly, a permissioned blockchain can be public or private. 

=== Bitcoin

Bitcoin, the name is well suited and catch attention from tech-savvy people. I have already discussed a little bitcoin earlier in this paper. 

Bitcoin tales started in 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto, proposed a solution to solve double spending problem and ditch central authorities those who take over the transaction from our very hands and take much time to process along with a fee.

=== Why did we need it?

Earlier when we did not have any currency, people used to trade stuff like crops, goods, etc. and fulfill their daily needs. But later on, the concept of currency was developed. It evolved over time and led to paper money in exchange for gold with world bank.  Later on, keeping gold was not an option anymore, and government can print currency whenever in need. Printing money wasn't a problem, but it caused to inflection and became invaluable over time. What we could purchase with 1 Unit is way costly nowadays. 

Another problem was that people were stacking money in banks and banks could lend the same money up to 90% back to people. These financial institutions were acting as a central authority to circulate cash within society, and all the transactions, going through the are chargeable. This ultimate business model was efficient for financial institutions but not good for people who need privacy and security. 
Satoshi Nakamoto, rescued us by proving a practical approach to solve these problems.
